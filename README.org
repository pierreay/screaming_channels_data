* About

Data of the Screaming Channels on BLE project.

This repository using Git and Git-Annex containing datasets and experiments
related to the Screaming Channels on BLE project.

* Organization

- [[file:datasets]] :: Contains full datasets recorded using the Nimble stack (=ble=)
  or the custom firmware (=poc=).
- [[file:experiments]] :: Contains experiments scripts and small recordings.
- [[file:scripts/check_traces_archives.sh]] :: Check that archives (commited using
  =git-annex=) are consistent with current trace directories (ignored by
  =git=).
- [[file:profiles/][profiles]] :: Contains some good [[id:71833b59-2215-482f-ba78-49a153b607ad][profiles]] for template attacks.
- [[file:signals/][signals]] :: Contains some good [[id:108f8a72-7097-46ce-9457-191988296c92][signals]] for autocorrelation matching.

- [[attachment:2.548GHz_30Msps_AES_BLE_clean_leak_single.npy][2.548GHz_30Msps_AES_BLE_clean_leak_single.npy]] :: Template of a single
  (non-averaged) key scheduling with 2 first rounds of an AES executed during a
  BLE transmission, collected at 2.548 GHz using 30 Msps, using an USRP
  B200mini and an RF coax cable inside an anechoic box.
