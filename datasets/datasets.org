- [[file:poc/240222_custom_firmware_phase_eval]] ::
  - ~11k * 300 (rep) profile traces (amplitude + phase rotation, no IQ).
  - ~16k * 300 (rep) attack traces. (amplitude + phase rotation, no IQ).
  - Anechoic box, no LNA, small Wi-Fi antenna.
  - 2.512 GHz of center frequency, 8 MHz of bandwidth.
  - Custom firmware from Giovanni, only carrier (without modulation) and AES software.
  - Correlation of about ~0.9 for amplitude profile and about ~1 for phase profile.
  - Both attacks are very effective, lowering the key rank to 2^30 using 30 to
    300 attack traces.
- [[file:poc/240305_custom_firmware_phase_eval_iq]] ::
  - Same configuration as previous dataset but:
    - Keep I and Q.
    - Compute I and Q augmented (new concept).
  - Good profiles of ~3k traces with r = 1 for correlation.
  - Attacks up to 200 traces.
  - Attacks successful with amp, phr, i_augmented, q_augmented.
  - Attacks failed with i and q.
- [[file:poc/240306_custom_firmware_phase_eval_iq_norep]] ::
  - 16k traces for training set.
  - 4k traces for attack set.
  - Same configuration as previous dataset but:
    - Disable repetitions.
  - Profiles used several correlations algorithms (=r=, =t=, =snr=, =corr=). Because =r=
    is not working in this case (find correlations but doesn't find POI for
    unknown reasons), =snr= gives best results.
  - See that no repetitions has a high influence on the attack results even if
    the traces looks good.
  - =phr= is not better than =amp=.
  - =i_augmented= is nearly as powerful than =amp= but not better.
- [[file:poc/240308_custom_firmware_phase_eval_iq_norep_2sr]] ::
  - Same configuration as previous dataset but with double sampling rate (from
    8e6 to 16e6).
  - Results are that it leads to worse key rank for all profiles.

:END:

- Summary ::
  - 16k profile traces.
  - 16k attack traces.
  - Same configuration as previous (x2) dataset but with GFSK modulation ON.
  - This collect with GFSK modulation clearly impact performances. Notes:
    - It is unclear how it affects performance, since all profiles are affected
      (even amplitude).
    - More factor are present than the GFSK modulation, like the deep fades
      between packets boundaries.
    - The less impacted attack is the phase rotation (only 2^3 of difference of
      keyrank) compared to the others.
  - On this dataset, i_augmented is the better performance attack.

- =ble/231213_single-cable_raw= :: The firmware is close as stock -- only using
  AES software and increased TX power. We use a pairing to generate keys, with
  Butterfly and WHAD on the attacker side. We attacked the amplitude of the
  signal received at 2.548 GHz during the legitimate BLE transmission emitted
  when a connection is started. We do not used any averaging or instrumeted AES
  repetitions -- only offline triggering and trace alignment. We were able to
  retrieve 5 bytes of the key with a very low median/mean PGE, but the maximum
  PGE of only 1 byte don't allow an efficient bruteforce.

- Comments ::
  1. Attack =A0= is the attempt of profile re-usage from instrumented Nimble to
     non-instrumented Nimble (=AMPLITUDE_16000_r_1= /a.k.a./ =P0= from
     [[id:0936568c-d3f9-4c18-841f-5dadecf0118a][[2024-04-23 mar.]​]]). However, the profile is statistically slightly
     different than actual attacked traces making the re-usage impossible.
