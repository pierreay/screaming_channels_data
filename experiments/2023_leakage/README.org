#+TITLE: Side-channel leakage inside FF trace
#+SETUPFILE: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierreay/orgcss/master/orgcss.setup

* About

The goal of this experiment is to use side-channels techniques (/e.g./
Variance, SNR) to analyze our traces and find any leakage.

This experiment takes place after the end of the [[id:f47bfbf0-da0a-424e-9b0e-97410072398a][FF AES during BLE Leak
Collection]] experiment, using the [[orgit-rev:~/work/info/projs/screaming_channels_annex/::77b49b5d9c65287f87c7f4feeb39d7ead53d8824][~/work/info/projs/screaming_channels_annex/
(magit-rev 77b49b5d9)]] dataset from the =67059239-5b11-49b2-86ba-6c6ed84c3f28=
key.

WARNING: In this dataset, the SKD of the attacker was not saved properly
(fail). But, it was constantly set to =0xdeadbeefdeadbeef=, so it can be fixed
while loading the plaintext.

First, I wanted to plot the signal and the variance over a large transmissions
(4 messages in NF and 1 leak in FF):

We can notice that:
- We have variance for all messages.
- When the AES happened is not an evidence using the variance. Maybe the 1st
  round variance is the level up before the last peak?
- The absolute value of the variance is pretty low.

Conclusion: Maybe we should use averaging and alignment or SNR...

We can notice that we see variance after the message in FF... would it means
that the AES leak after the radio transmissions? Is there plot shifted?

For a fixed subbyte number, computing the variance accross traces having the
same subbyte value should lead to a lower variance at this subbyte position in
the time-domain of the trace. It will allows to identify where is interesting
part is, confirming that there is a value-dependent leakage, and allows us to
align & average traces with the same subbyte value to increase trace quality.
